database.\n\n  Initial data:\n  - Start by loading initial data with the \\\"Load Real Data\\\" button.\n  - This will load some sample datoms from the ego.datoms file\n\n  Executing queries:\n  - The browse-box uses [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci) to execute datascript queries.\n  - In addition to the (non-side-effecting) clojure.core functions, the following bindings are available:\n  - `athens/db` -> the datascript connection, dereference (`@`) to get the current database value\n  - `d/q` -> for querying the database\n  - `d/pull` -> pull one or more attributes of an entity, returns a map\n  - `d/pull-many` -> like `d/pull`, but pulls many entities at once\n  - Execute the query by pressing `shift-enter`\n\n  Browsing:\n  - The browser is a simple html table translating the query result into rows and cells.\n  - Browsing is possible if you've used a pull expression (in a query or with `d/pull` or `d/pull-many`).\n  - If you click a link, it will generate a new query and evaluate it.\n\n  History:\n  - Devcards keeps a history for us. Use the arrows at the bottom to navigate back to earlier states.\n\n  Possible improvements:\n  - Right now navigation is only possible by using a pull expression. By analysing queries it might also be possible for all other queries.\n  - No transctions are currently allowed, but this can easily be changed by adding `d/transact` to sci's bindings.\n  - There is absolutely no styling, some minimal styling would probably make reading the table easier.\n  \")\n\n\n(def initial-box\n  {:str-content\n   \"(d/q '[:find [(pull ?e [*]) ...]\n       :where [?e :node/title]]\n    @athens/db)\"\n   :limit 10})\n\n\n(defonce box-state*\n  (r/atom initial-box))\n\n\n(defn eval-box\n  [{:keys [str-content] :as box}]\n  (let [bindings {'athens/db db/dsdb\n                  'd/q d/q\n                  'd/pull d/pull\n                  'd/pull-many d/pull-many}\n        [ok? result] (try\n                       [true (sci/eval-string str-content {:bindings bindings})]\n                       (catch js/Error e [false e]))]\n    (-> box\n        (assoc :result result)\n        (assoc :error (not ok?)))))\n\n\n(defn eval-box!\n  []\n  (swap! box-state* eval-box))\n\n\n(defn update-box!\n  [s]\n  (swap! box-state* assoc :str-content s))\n\n\n(defn update-and-eval-box!\n  [s]\n  (swap! box-state*\n         #(-> %\n              (assoc :str-content s)\n              (eval-box))))\n\n\n(defn increase-limit!\n  []\n  (swap! box-state* update :limit + 10))\n\n\n(defn load-real-db!\n  [conn]\n  (go\n    (let [res (<!

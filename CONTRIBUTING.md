# Contributing to Athens

If you're looking for somewhere to start contributing, check out the issues tagged with "first issue" found in [issues](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues). If you have a specific feature that you would like to work on (for which there is no open issue yet), please let us know.

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Before contributing, please first read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Communication Channels

Most communication about Athens development happens in the #athens channel in the [Roam Slack](https://roamresearch.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtODg3NjIzODEwNDgwLTdhMjczMGYwN2YyNmMzMDcyZjViZDk0MTA2M2UxOGM5NTMxNDVhNDE1YWVkNTFjMGM4OTE3MTQ3MjEzNzE1MTA). 

You can also reach out to Jeff on Twitter at [@tangjeff0](https://twitter.com/tangjeff0). He posts regular updates about this project. We will make an Athens Research Twitter account later at a suitable time. 

## Development Environment

See the setup in the README. (To be updated soon.)

## Clojure

Until stated otherwise, we will be following [this style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide). ([This version](https://guide.clojure.style) is prettier to look at.) This guide is still a work in progress; from the author: "Feel free to [open tickets or send pull requests](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide/issues) with improvements." Exceptions to this style guide will be collated and organized as needed. Feel free to suggest exceptions that you feel strongly about.  

We will soon likely setup [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo) with some config as a project linter. The clj-kondo linter follows the style guidelines in the above style guide.
